**Executive Summary**

The executive summary must be a clearly defined description of the project. This
includes the descriptions of why the system is design (motivation), expected changes resulting from the
new system (organizational structure and authority and control), and the potential open source
communities that would be engaged with to support this project (social responsibility).
